abstract = {We propose a new latent factor conditional asset pricing model. Like Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (KPS, 2019), our model allows for latent factors and factor exposures that depend on covariates such as asset characteristics. But, unlike the linearity assumption of KPS, we model factor exposures as a flexible nonlinear function of covariates. Our model retrofits the workhorse unsupervised dimension reduction device from the machine learning literature – autoencoder neural networks – to incorporate information from covariates along with returns themselves. This delivers estimates of nonlinear conditional exposures and the associated latent factors. Furthermore, our machine learning framework imposes the economic restriction of no-arbitrage. Our autoencoder asset pricing model delivers out-of-sample pricing errors that are far smaller (and generally insignificant) compared to other leading factor models.}

abstract = {We propose a new modeling approach for the cross section of returns. Our method, Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA), allows for latent factors and time-varying loadings by introducing observable characteristics that instrument for the unobservable dynamic loadings. If the characteristics/expected return relationship is driven by compensation for exposure to latent risk factors, IPCA will identify the corresponding latent factors. If no such factors exist, IPCA infers that the characteristic effect is compensation without risk and allocates it to an “anomaly” intercept. Studying returns and characteristics at the stock-level, we find that five IPCA factors explain the cross section of average returns significantly more accurately than existing factor models and produce characteristic-associated anomaly intercepts that are small and statistically insignificant. Furthermore, among a large collection of characteristics explored in the literature, only ten are statistically significant at the 1% level in the IPCA specification and are responsible for nearly 100% of the model’s accuracy.}
